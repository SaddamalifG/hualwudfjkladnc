            <p>Dear Nurul Zahra Nafila,</p>
            <p></p>
            <p>As I sit down to write this letter, my heart swells with gratitude for you. Thank you for accepting me, flaws and all, and for embracing the baggage I carry. Your love has been a beacon of light in my life, illuminating the darkest corners of my soul.</p>
            <p>I am endlessly thankful for your patience with my quiet nature, my aloofness, my shyness, and my tendency to joke around too much. You see me for who I am, and that is a gift I cherish deeply. Being with you has transformed my life in ways I never thought possible.</p>
            <p>With you by my side, I have found a renewed passion for life. You have given me a purpose, a reason to strive to be the best version of myself, all to be worthy of standing next to you.</p>
            <p>Thank you, from the bottom of my heart, for being my partner in this beautiful journey. I am so grateful to have you in my life.</p>
            <p>With all my love, Sadman
            </p>
