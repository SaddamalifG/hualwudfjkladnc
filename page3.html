            <p>Beloved Nurul Zahra Nafila,</p>
            <p>Each day begins with the anticipation of your message, a sweet reminder that you are in my life. Our morning conversations are a delightful puzzle, where I ponder what we will discuss today.</p>
            <p>From serious topics that make us think, to my silly jokes that sometimes annoy you, every moment spent talking with you is a treasure. I could chat with you until the stars fill the night sky, exploring countless subjects, yet always with you as my favorite companion.</p>
            <p>As we navigate the challenges that life throws our way, I hope we remain together, for I cannot envision my future without you by my side.</p>
            <p>Lastly, thank you for choosing to be with me. You are the best woman I could ever hope to have in my life. I love you more than words can express.</p>
            <p>Hopefully yours forever, Sadman</p>
